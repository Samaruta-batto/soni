# Soni Exim - Website Redevelopment Project

This project is a complete rebuild and modernization of the corporate website for **Soni Exim**, a company specializing in premium essential oils, carrier oils, and natural extracts. The primary goal was to transform a static informational site into a sophisticated, e-commerce-style product catalog, enhancing the brand's digital presence and improving the user experience.

The redevelopment focused on creating a visually stunning, intuitive, and interactive platform that effectively showcases the quality and diversity of Soni Exim's product line, giving it the feel of a high-end online store without the complexities of actual e-commerce functionality.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Modern & Responsive Design:** A fully responsive and mobile-first interface built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, ensuring a seamless experience across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
*   **Dynamic Product Catalog:** An elegant and interactive product gallery that beautifully showcases the company's oils. Products are categorized, and each has a detailed view accessible via a modal, mimicking a premium e-commerce experience.
*   **AI-Powered Recommendations:** A standout feature is the "AI Recommender," which uses Google's Gemini Pro model via **Genkit**. Users can describe their needs (e.g., "I need help relaxing"), and the AI will analyze the product data to provide personalized essential oil recommendations.
*   **Immersive User Experience:** The UI is designed to be engaging, featuring a fixed nature-themed background, translucent content cards that "float" above it, and smooth animations. Interactive elements like flipping cards are used to present information in a dynamic and space-efficient way.
*   **Consistent & Professional Branding:** A clean, natural, and light color theme was implemented to reflect the company's focus on pure and natural products. The branding is consistent across all pages and components.
